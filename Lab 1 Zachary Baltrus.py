# This program will find the area of a triangle
# We will first find the base and height of the triangle
# Then to find the area of the triangle we will use the formula .5(base) * (height)

# This is the base value
base = eval(input("Base = "))

# This is the height value
height = eval(input("Height = "))

# This is where the formula for the area is
area = .5 * base * height

# This will finally display the area of the trianlge
print("Area= %.3f" % area , "inches")
